# More about class

- Create a class named `Square` which accepts one parameter `side` and will set two property `width` and `height` to the value of `side`.
```js
```
```js
class Square{
    constructor(side){
        this.width = side;
        this.height = side;
        this.numberOfTime = 0;
    }
    description(){
        alert(`The square is ${this.width} x ${this.height}`);
    }
    calcArea(){
        return this.width ** 2;
    }
    get area(){
         if(this.numberOfTime > 3){
           return `Upper Limit Reached`;
        }
        this.numberOfTime ++;
        return this.width ** 2;
    }
    set area(area){
        // if(count > 3){
        //    return `Upper Limit Reached`;
        // }
        // numberOfTime ++;
        this.width = Math.sqrt(area);
        this.height = Math.sqrt(area);
    }
    static isEqual(square1, square2){
        return square1.width === square2.width && square1.height === square2.height;
    }
}
```
- Add a method name `description` that will alert a mesage saying `The square is ${width} x ${height}`

- Create a method inside the class named `calcArea` that will return the area of the square.

- Create a `area` getter method usin`g which we can get the area of the square.

- Create a `area` setter method that will accept the area of the square. Based on the value of area it will set the value of `width` and `height`. If the passed value is not the area of the square alert say `Not a valid input`

- Create a static method named `isEqual` which accepts two `square` object with `width` and `height` property. If the area of both square is same it will return `true` or `false`.

- Create another property named `numberOfTimes` that will hold the value of number of times the area property is accessed from the object. The values will initialize to `0`. The area property can't be accessed more than 4 times. If it crosses 4 times alert message `Upper Limit Reached`

- Create two instance of the `Square` class
```js
let square1 = new Square(4);
let square2 = new Square(5);
```

- Check the `area` getter method on both square. Check the `area` property on one square more than 4 times.
```js
Square.get;
```
- Check the `isEqual` method and pass the two instance you created above.

## User Class

- Create a `User` class that accepts `firstName` and `lastName` property

- Create a getter method named `fullName` that will return the full name of the person.

- Create a `fullName` setter method that will accept full name parameter of the person. It will update the `firstName` and `lastName` based on the input. Say if the user passed `Arya Stark` it will update the `firstName` to `Arya` and `lastName` to `Stark`. It will also change one condition if the length of the name passed is less than 5 characters it will alert a message saying `Full name should be more than 5 characters`

- Create a method named `nameContains` which will accept string and will return `true` or `false` based on if the name of the user contains the text that passed by user.

- Create two instance of the `User` class

- Check by using the `fullName` setter method with name bigger than 5 characters.

- Check by using the `fullName` setter method with name less than 5 characters.

- Check the `fullName` using getter

- Check the `nameContains` method

```js
class User{
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName
    }
    get fullName(){
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
    set fullName(name){
        if(name.length < 6){
            alert(`Full name should be more than 5 characters`)
        }else{
            console.log("split")
          name = name.split(" ");
          this.firstName = name[0];
          this.lastName = name[1];
        }
          
    }
    nameContains(string){
        return (this.firstName + this.lastName).includes(string)
    }
}

let user1 = new User("deepak","singh");
let user2 = new User("dpk","hfahf");

```
